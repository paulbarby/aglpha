Explanation of Key Components
Map Generation
Perlin Noise: The noise library generates a 2D array of noise values, which are mapped to terrain types based on thresholds from config.ini.

Rendering: Each tile is drawn as a colored rectangle using placeholder colors from terrain_colors.

Units
Units are simple objects with position and type, rendered as red circles on the map.

Selection and movement are handled via mouse clicks, with a "Move" button in the UI triggering movement mode.

UI
When a unit is selected, a gray panel appears with the unit’s type and a "Move" button.

Clicking "Move" allows the player to click a destination tile.

Input Handling
Mouse: Clicking a tile selects a unit if present, clicking "Move" enables movement, and clicking elsewhere deselects.

Keyboard: 'S' saves the game, 'L' loads it.

Persistence
SQLite3: Two tables (map_tiles and units) store the terrain and unit data. The game state is saved to savegame.db and can be reloaded.

Config
Settings are read from config.ini, making it easy to tweak map size, noise parameters, and graphics settings.

Expanding Features
This is a minimal prototype, but the modular design allows for expansion:
Cities: Add a City class and store city data in SQLite3.

Combat: Implement unit stats (e.g., health, attack) and combat logic.

Turn System: Enhance with movement points and end-turn logic.

AI: Add basic AI opponents.

Graphics: Replace placeholders with sprites.

Fog of War: Hide unexplored tiles.

Resources: Add resources to tiles, affecting gameplay.

To expand, modify the Unit class for additional properties, enhance the Map class for new tile features, and update the database schema accordingly.
Running the Game
Save the code in a file (e.g., game.py).

Create config.ini in the same directory.

Run the script: python game.py.

You’ll see a map with two units (red circles). Click a unit to see the UI, click "Move" to enter movement mode, then click a tile to move the unit. Press 'S' to save, 'L' to load.
