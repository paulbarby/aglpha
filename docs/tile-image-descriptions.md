**List of Tiles for AI Image Creation**

---

## **1. Basic Terrain Tiles**

- **Grassland**: A lush green plain with scattered patches of flowers and bushes, soft rolling hills, and occasional dirt paths.
- **Forest**: Dense clusters of trees with a mix of evergreens and deciduous foliage, sunlight filtering through the canopy, and a forest floor covered in leaves and undergrowth.
- **Desert**: Expansive golden dunes with rippled textures, occasional patches of dry cracked earth, and sparse cacti or desert shrubs.
- **Tundra**: A frozen landscape with patches of snow-covered ground, icy rocks, and short hardy vegetation like moss and shrubs.
- **Swamp**: Murky, shallow water with clusters of reeds, moss-covered trees, and small wooden boardwalks or fallen logs.
- **Hills**: Elevated terrain covered with grass and rocks, offering a natural defense advantage and dotted with occasional trees.
- **Mountains**: Tall, rocky formations with jagged peaks, covered in snow at higher altitudes, with visible cliffs and deep shadows.
- **Water (Ocean/Lake)**: A deep blue expanse with gentle waves and occasional whitecaps, featuring lighter blue shallows near the shore.
- **River**: A winding waterway with a shimmering surface, lined with small pebbles, lush greenery, and occasional sandbanks.
- **Volcanic Terrain**: Dark, hardened lava rock with occasional plumes of steam or small glowing cracks of molten lava beneath the surface.

## **2. Resource Tiles**

- **Farmland**: Carefully plowed fields with rows of crops such as wheat, corn, or rice, with farmhouses and windmills in the background.
- **Mine (Iron, Copper, Tin, Coal, Gold, Uranium)**: A rocky excavation site with wooden supports, mining carts, and visible mineral veins embedded in the rock.
- **Lumber Camp (Wood Resource)**: A logging area with stacks of freshly cut timber, tree stumps, and workers wielding axes and saws.
- **Quarry (Stone Resource)**: A large pit filled with slabs of cut stone, piles of gravel, and wooden scaffolding used for extraction.
- **Oil Field**: An industrial zone with black oil seeps, tall metal drilling rigs, and storage tanks for extracted crude oil.
- **Fishing Grounds**: Coastal waters with schools of fish visible beneath the surface, small fishing boats with nets, and wooden piers extending into the water.
- **Horse Pasture**: Open fields with wooden fences, grazing horses, and a few stable buildings in the background.

## **3. Man-Made Structures & Upgraded Tiles**

- **Road**: A dirt or cobblestone pathway winding through the landscape, flanked by occasional signposts and cart tracks.
- **Railroad**: A set of parallel steel tracks supported by wooden ties and gravel, curving across the terrain and sometimes passing over bridges.
- **Bridge (Over River/Lake)**: A wooden or stone structure spanning a waterway, with railings and supports visible beneath.
- **Farm with Irrigation**: Advanced farmlands with neatly arranged irrigation channels, lush green crops, and modern farming equipment.
- **Fortified Wall**: A tall stone barrier with battlements, guard towers, and wooden walkways along the top for defenders.
- **Harbor/Dockyard**: A bustling coastal area with wooden piers, large trading ships, storage warehouses, and cranes unloading cargo.
- **Cityscape (Various Ages)**: An evolving urban environment, ranging from small huts and simple brick houses to towering skyscrapers and industrial districts.

## **4. Special & Unique Tiles**

- **Ancient Ruins**: Crumbling stone structures overtaken by nature, with vines growing over broken columns and faded carvings.
- **Sacred Grove**: A mystical glade with glowing trees, softly shimmering lights, and a sense of tranquility.
- **Oasis**: A small fertile patch in the desert with a freshwater pond, palm trees, and scattered tents or settlements.
- **Glacier**: A massive frozen expanse with towering ice cliffs, deep crevasses, and reflections of sunlight creating a blue glow.
- **Craters (Meteor Impact)**: A massive, scorched crater with jagged rocks, steam rising from the center, and occasional alien-like minerals.
- **Nuclear Fallout Zone**: A devastated wasteland with charred earth, skeletal trees, and a faint greenish glow of radiation in certain areas.

## **Notes for AI Image Generation**

- Each tile should have **distinct textures and visual elements** appropriate to its function.
- Natural tiles should feature **realistic weathering and organic variation** (e.g., worn-out trails on grasslands, leaf litter in forests).
- Resource tiles should be **visually identifiable** by including key elements (e.g., visible gold veins in mines, oil rigs in oil fields).
- Man-made structures should reflect **historical and technological evolution**, from dirt roads to paved highways and ancient walls to modern fortifications.
- Special tiles should have **unique color palettes and lighting effects** to enhance their visual storytelling (e.g., glowing blue ice for glaciers, eerie green for radiation zones).

This list ensures that AI-generated images accurately reflect the diverse tile types in the game world.
